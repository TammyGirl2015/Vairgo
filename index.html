              midweek flights to loyalty programs. Sign up in the Discover More

              Whether you just need somewhere to lay your head or you're looking
              to go all out and enjoy some relaxation time with awesome views
              and long baths overlooking the mountains, sign up and discover
              more with us as we share a wide range of accommodations suitable
              for every pocket too. I have had the pleasure of backpacking in
              the city to camping under the stars to fine dining in 5 star
              hotels. I often find that my choice of accomodation depends on the
              city i am travelling to. Some just have the appeal of relaxing by
              the beach (ok, to be fair i love the water and it is usually
              always a feature of my travels!), while sometimes i enjoy getting
              to mingle with the locals a bit more in a less tourist-y set up.

              I might be biased in my recommendations BUT along with my personal
              favorites, you will get to see all the places i have explored and
              i will be sharing some travel fails, some that i've had to learn
              the hard way. My recommendations also include links to essentials
              like taxi services, ratings of what mobile networks work best, a
              general idea of the <i>actual</i> weather- all the things you
              sometimes miss in the excitent of planning a trip, or maybe you're
              just not great at itineraries. Whichever the case, sign up to
              receive recommendations on all the destinations i have explored.
